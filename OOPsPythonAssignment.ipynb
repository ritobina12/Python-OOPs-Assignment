        "**Theory Questions Answers**\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects rather than functions and logic. It focuses on creating reusable code through concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: An object is an instance of a class. It's a self-contained component that contains properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) defined by its class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: Abstraction focuses on hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential features, while encapsulation is about bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to some components.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: Dunder methods (double underscore methods) are special methods in Python that start and end with double underscores (e.g., __init__, __str__). They allow classes to implement operator overloading and other special behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (child/derived class) inherits attributes and methods from an existing class (parent/base class). It promotes code reusability and establishes relationships between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: Polymorphism means \"many forms\" and refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same method call in different ways. It allows methods to do different things based on the object calling them.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: Encapsulation in Python is achieved by using private variables (prefixed with _ or __) and providing public methods (getters/setters) to access and modify them. However, Python doesn't enforce strict encapsulation like some other languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: A constructor is a special method (__init__) that is automatically called when an object of a class is created. It's used to initialize the object's attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: Class methods are methods bound to the class rather than the instance. They take cls as the first parameter and can modify class state. Static methods are utility methods that don't have access to class or instance state and are defined using the @staticmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: Method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. Python doesn't support traditional method overloading, but it can be simulated using default arguments or variable-length arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: Method overriding occurs when a child class provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: The @property decorator allows a method to be accessed like an attribute, providing a way to implement getters, setters, and deleters for class attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: Polymorphism allows for flexible and maintainable code by enabling a single interface to work with different data types. It makes code more readable and reduces complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is meant to be subclassed. It contains one or more abstract methods that must be implemented by its subclasses. In Python, abstract classes are created using the abc module.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: Advantages include: code reusability, modularity, easier maintenance, better organization, data hiding/security, and easier modeling of real-world scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: Class variables are shared by all instances of the class and are defined within the class but outside any methods. Instance variables are unique to each instance and are defined inside methods (typically __init__).\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: Multiple inheritance is when a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. Python supports multiple inheritance, unlike some other languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: __str__ provides a user-friendly string representation of an object (used by print() and str()), while __repr__ provides an unambiguous string representation (used by the interpreter and repr() function), ideally for debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: super() returns a temporary object of the superclass, allowing you to call its methods. It's commonly used in inheritance to call parent class methods, especially in method overriding.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: __del__ is a destructor method called when an object is about to be destroyed. It's used to perform cleanup operations before the object is garbage collected.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: @classmethod takes the class (cls) as first argument and can access/modify class state, while @staticmethod doesn't take any special first argument and can't modify class or instance state.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: In Python, polymorphism with inheritance allows child classes to override parent class methods. When a method is called on an object, Python checks the object's class first, then its parent classes, executing the first matching method found.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: Method chaining is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in sequence, with each method returning the object itself (typically self), allowing the calls to be chained together in a single statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: The __call__ method allows an instance of a class to be called like a function. When defined, you can use the syntax instance() which will invoke the __call__ method."
